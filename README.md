This code calculates the thermal efficiency of the ideal Otto Cycle and plots (p-V) diagram
Author: Nicholas Santaniello Date:5/10/22
INPUT: User dependent for values for both geometry and equation variables (Temp, pressure, ratio of specific heats) OUTPUT: png with corresponding p-V diagram
EXECUTION: To execute the code enter values as prompted. Suggested motor geometry and variables are listed, but any value shall be used.
TEST_INPUT: Suggested inputs listed in code (using compression ratio of 8). TEST_OUTPUT: Thermal Efficiency of the Otto Cycle = 64.644661%
